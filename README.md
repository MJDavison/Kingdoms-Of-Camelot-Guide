# Kingdoms Of Camelot Guide

This is a website based on a website I made in my early days of school. It's not a impressive site... or rather it's pretty terrible. The aim is to show growth from my first ever website to what I am capable of today.

At this point in time, I seriously looked down on CSS, something along the lines of "Why would I bother with CSS? Bootstrap exists!"... obviously not realising what bootstrap actually was.

This page was made in a single IT lesson- At the time I thought it was very impressive. Knowing how to use bootstraps grid to make things look centered was something I was especially proud of... 

Of course, I never actually made a second article, but for some reason I think I believed that navigation would just... magically appear.
