                Firstly, you'll notice that you have very little resources. This is the first issue you'll want to resolve. If you look in the top left corner, you'll see "Field". 
                Click that to enter your farming area. You should have 13 building slots.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Resources aren't equally easy to obtain, Food is the easiest thing to get, followed by wood, stone and then ore. You'll also notice that buildings take different amounts of each resource- some take none of certain resources.
                Once you build your fields and level them up, it will take forever to deconstruct if you change your mind. For now, just build one of each.                 
            </p>
<p>
    Early on, you'll want to make a choice: Join a alliance or struggle solo. If you join a alliance, you'll probably be sent a "starter pack", which is anywhere between 1 million to 10 million of each resource. 
                If you do that, you can ignore your field for the most part- the fields are a very minor part of resource gathering- it's mostly meant for those early days before you can start farming barbican camps.

               
</p>
<p>
    The rest of this article will assume that you did decide to join a alliance, I'll write a seperate article later on how to grow without joining one.

    
</p>
<p>
    To join a alliance, you must build a embassy. That costs a whole 2000 wood- you might have to wait for the wood to be refilled by your fields before you can build it.
    Once you built it, you can click it to open it. Once it's open, click "View Alliances".
    Next, you go to "Alliance List" then "Request To Join". If you get accepted, you'll be in the alliance.

    
</p>
<p>
    Now, once you're in the alliance, you'll want to go to the "Map", it's up there near "Fields". By default, the map will be centered on your city.
    Hover over your city and you'll see a set of co-ordinates, share those cordinates with your alliance in alliance chat and politely ask for a starter pack.

    
</p>
<p>
    Once the resources arrive, you'll want to start aiming for archers.
    Go back into your city and build a barrack, then click "train" on the archers- it will tell you the requirements for training them. This will include "research" such as "fletching". You'll also have to level your barracks up... but once you can finally train archers, you'll be able to start farming barbican camps.

    My next guide will cover farming barbican camps, discussing how many archers you'll need and what ressearch buffs you'll want to have first.
